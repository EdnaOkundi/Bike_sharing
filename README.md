# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to creaate a proposal for bringing bike rentals to Des Moines, Iowa using Tableau.

# Results
The following visualizations were created for the proposal.
Starting Location
Checkout Times by Users and Genders
Customers by Type
Trips by Gender Heatmap
Trips by Weekday Heatma
Trips by User and Gender Type Heatmap

The above visualization shows the locations of where bikes are checked out. The circle size and 
color correspond to the number of bikes checked out. These results show a higher amount of bike checkouts occuring in lower to mid Manhattan.
This visualization also uses a heatmap, but breaksdown usage by User Type and Gender throughout the week. 
Here we can see Male Subscribers have a much higher concentration compared to the others. 

Summary
Based upon the visualizations above, we can see that the vast majority of usage comes from 
Subscribers that are Male using bikes during weekday commutes in the morning and evening.
Additional visualizations could include showing which Stations correspond to the most amount of bike rentals. 
Also a visualization showing the age of the average customer compared to how long they rent a bike could be helpful.
